Jason was section editor for Java Developer’s Journal, a writer on IBM DeveloperWorks, the Belfast Telegraph and written about BigData for Ulster Business magazine. He’s also delivered the odd keynote on the realities of Big Data, using Hadoop and trained various organisations in Big Data technologies. 

Now he is Senior DataOps Engineer with Digitalis.io specialising in Kafka, Pulsar, Hadoop and Cassandra DataOps and support. Previously Jason worked with Mastodon C, Minoro Data, Yapster, Ulster University, Airpos, Learning Pool, Obongo, The Press Association and various other startups and companies in the UK and the US.

Oh, and he plays the Chapman Stick….
